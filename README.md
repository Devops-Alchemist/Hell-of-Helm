# 😈 Hell of Helm

Welcome to **Hell of Helm** — a chaotic and brutally honest journey through the wonderful world of Kubernetes Helm charts.  
Created and cursed by **Arun**, who's been templating, debugging, and screaming at `values.yaml` since Day 1.

> *"Because Helm promised simplicity... but forgot to mention the YAML-shaped demons."*

## 🔥 What's This Repo About?

This is not a polished tutorial — this is real, raw learning. I'm using this repo to:

- 💣 Break Helm on purpose (and sometimes by accident)
- 📦 Build custom Helm charts from scratch
- 🔁 Deploy, destroy, and debug Kubernetes resources
- 🤯 Figure out why Helm does what it does
- 📝 Document mistakes and lessons learned
